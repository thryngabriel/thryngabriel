# Hi! I'm Kathryn

This is my website. It's a work in progress. :)


## About me

I am a software developer based in Victoria, BC. My work experience so far has been primarily in web dev with JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#: Node.js or ASP.NET backends and React frontends. For database work I have used PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Entity Framework. I also have a year of co-op experience building a native Android app, which I took from scratch to production, that connects over Bluetooth to custom Arduino-powered devices developed by my employer (I worked on some of the Arduino code for them too!).

My most recent experience has been work with machine learning. As part of the AI4Good bootcamp, I led a team that built a visualization tool to assess unmet healthcare needs in Canada using unsupervised learning with Gaussian Mixture Modelling in python. For my final co-op work term last summer, I trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network using Julia to provide quality control for oceanography signal data.

Right now, I am practicing frontend web development (by making this portfolio site!) and studying full-stack web and native development in C# (.NET MAUI).

## About the site

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so if you want to pull and try running it locally (for whatever reason) you can do so using `npm start` and it will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

It is deployed using Firebase at [https://thryngabriel.com/](https://thryngabriel.com/).
